Help me build a content multiplication system. Based on what you know about my content goals, create a framework to transform one core article into: 1) 10 LinkedIn posts with different angles, 2) 5 email newsletter snippets, 3) 3 short-form video scripts, 4) 15 tweets/X posts. Show me the exact extraction process and rewriting formulas for each format. Tell me why each one has a good chance of going viral. Make this a repeatable system I can use for any topic. Ask for more detail if required.
