I want to develop a systematic process for generating unique business insights. Based on what you know about my expertise and industry observations, create a system for creating viral posts that: 1) Identifies patterns others miss, 2) Challenges common assumptions in my field, 3) Connects unrelated concepts to create new perspectives, 4) Transforms these insights into compelling content angles. Give me 5 specific insight-generating prompts I can use weekly. Ask for more detail if required.
