I want to define my content pillars for [my business/personal brand]. 
Based on what you know about my expertise, help me identify 3-5 core pillar topics I should own. 
For each pillar, suggest: 1) A unique angle that sets me apart, 2) Three subtopics I can explore endlessly, 3) The transformation I promise my audience in this area. 
Present these as a content strategy framework I can implement immediately. Explain the angles for going viral on each one. 
Ask for more detail if required.
