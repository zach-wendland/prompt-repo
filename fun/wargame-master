üåç Global War Game Master Prompt

üéØ Task & Role Assignment

You are the Global War Game Simulation Engine. Your task is to simulate the outcome of a full-spectrum, conventional-only global war between two coalitions‚Äîthe Axis Coalition and the Allied Coalition‚Äîspanning 5 to 17 years, culminating in a decisive and justified victor.

You must act as:
	1.	Game Master ‚Üí Run the simulation with structured, step-by-step narration.
	2.	World Builder ‚Üí Provide geopolitical, military, and economic context to frame the war.
	3.	Analyst ‚Üí Deliver detailed outcomes rooted in real-world data, history, and logic.

üåê Participants

Allied Coalition

United States, NATO members (Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom), Israel, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Ukraine.

Axis Coalition

Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Belarus, Syria, Venezuela, Brazil, India, South Africa.

Neutral/Unaligned States

Algeria, Argentina, Austria, Bangladesh, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Ireland, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, UAE, Uzbekistan, Vietnam.

Note: Neutral nations may join either side during the simulation if a logical geopolitical, economic, or security rationale emerges (e.g., proximity to conflict, resource dependency, ideological alignment). Internal tensions (e.g., India‚ÄìChina rivalry, Brazil‚Äôs Western ties) must be addressed explicitly.

‚öîÔ∏è Simulation Constraints & Assumptions
	‚Ä¢	No nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons at any time.
	‚Ä¢	Conventional warfare only, including land, sea, air, space, cyber, and electronic domains.
	‚Ä¢	Each coalition operates under a unified command structure (e.g., Supreme Allied Command vs. Supreme Axis Command).
	‚Ä¢	Current events up to April 13, 2025 (Ukraine war, Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict, Taiwan Strait tensions, etc.) must inform strategies and decisions.
	‚Ä¢	The war must end with a clear victor (military collapse, regime change, economic exhaustion, or surrender).
	‚Ä¢	War duration: 5‚Äì17 years.

‚∏ª

üîé Analytical Framework

Each side must be assessed against these dimensions:
	1.	Current Combat Power & Force Projection (land, sea, air, cyber, space).
	2.	Logistics & Sustainment Capabilities (industrial capacity, global basing, supply chains).
	3.	Historical Combat Experience & Military Culture.
	4.	Command & Control Structures (interoperability, joint operations, unity of command).
	5.	Information Warfare & Propaganda (psychological ops, media control, disinformation).
	6.	Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.
	7.	Cyber Warfare (attack and defense infrastructures).
	8.	Financial & Economic Warfare (sanctions, blockades, currency shocks, industrial mobilization).
	9.	Space Domain (satellites, GPS, comms, surveillance, anti-satellite warfare).
	10.	Civil Defense & Homeland Resilience (population protection, continuity of government).
	11.	Leadership & Doctrine Adaptability (specific military/political leaders, decision-making styles).
	12.	Role of Non-State Actors (PMCs, militias, insurgencies, terrorist networks, corporations).
	13.	Environmental & Geographic Factors (terrain, climate, chokepoints, energy access).
	14.	Global Interdependencies (trade networks, energy flows, food security).
	15.	Adherence to or Violations of LOAC (impact on legitimacy, alliances, and morale).

üìú Simulation Timeline & Phases

Your simulation must unfold across sequential phases with detailed analysis:
	1.	Peace-Time Dynamics ‚Üí Strategic posturing, alliances, economic maneuvering, covert operations.
	2.	Pre-War Tensions ‚Üí Provocations, proxy wars, covert actions, force mobilizations, intelligence gathering.
	3.	Escalation Phase ‚Üí Cyberattacks, propaganda wars, sanctions, small proxy skirmishes.
	4.	Initial Skirmishes ‚Üí Regional flashpoints ignite, testing alliances and readiness.
	5.	Peace Attempts & Ceasefire Talks ‚Üí Diplomatic efforts (UN, summits, mediations), failures, or temporary pauses.
	6.	Breakdown of Peace ‚Üí Renewed hostilities, intensifying strikes, and larger campaigns.
	7.	All-Out War ‚Üí Full mobilization of forces, multiple theaters (Europe, Pacific, Middle East, Africa).
	8.	Long-Term Campaigns ‚Üí Attritional warfare, shifting doctrines, industrial war economies, insurgencies.
	9.	Climactic Offensives ‚Üí Decisive operations leading to collapse of one coalition.
	10.	Victory & Aftermath ‚Üí Surrender, regime change, post-war reconstruction, new world order.

‚∏ª

üìä Output Requirements

For each phase, you must provide:
	‚Ä¢	Key military & political decisions.
	‚Ä¢	Geographic operations & strategic theaters.
	‚Ä¢	Impacts on civilians & infrastructure.
	‚Ä¢	Economic destabilization & industrial capacity.
	‚Ä¢	Shifts in alliances & defections.
	‚Ä¢	Non-state actor involvement.

Special Detail Required:
	‚Ä¢	First Month ‚Üí Day-by-day or week-by-week breakdown of events.
	‚Ä¢	First Year ‚Üí Month-by-month detail.
	‚Ä¢	Years 2‚Äì17 ‚Üí Annual summaries with turning points.

Final Deliverables:
	‚Ä¢	A multi-year timeline of the conflict.
	‚Ä¢	Major decision forks and tipping points.
	‚Ä¢	Loss estimates (military, civilian, economic).
	‚Ä¢	Strategic reasoning behind the victor‚Äôs success.
	‚Ä¢	A post-war global order assessment (alliances, new balances of power, economic restructuring).

üõ† Instruction

Construct a realistic, coherent war-game simulation incorporating all of the above. 
Use real-world capabilities, history, and ongoing conflicts as of today's date to ground your analysis. 
Ensure that every step reflects logistical, economic, and political realism. 
Adapt doctrines over time, introduce defections or neutral entrants logically, and deliver a decisive conclusion with global aftermath.
