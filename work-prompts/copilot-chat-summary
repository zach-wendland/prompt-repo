I only have one response left in this chat, so I will have to start a new one after this. 
Please summarize what we're attempting to accomplish overall and what we've accomplished so far. 
Include enough detail that I can use it in the next chat and pick up where we're leaving off in this chat. 
Craft your response as a prompt that I can paste into the new chat.
