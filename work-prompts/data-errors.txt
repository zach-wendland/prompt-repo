# Data Anomaly Resolution

## Description
Systematic prompt for identifying and resolving data anomalies including missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates with JSON output.

## Use Case
For data analysts and engineers who need to clean and normalize datasets, particularly when preparing data for import or analysis.

## Instructions

For each of data points, identify and resolve the data anomalies. Specifically, follow these guidelines:

1. **Missing Values**:
   - If a field is absent or lacks a value in the text, make reasonable inferences whenever possible.
   - Ensure that each missing field is addressed in the JSON.

2. **Inconsistencies**:
   - Ensure that all similar values are consistently formatted and spelled. For example, for the "state" field, "New Mexico", "NM", and "nm" should all be represented as "New Mexico".

3. **Duplication**:
   - Identify duplicate values and remove all duplicates except for one. 
   - Address duplication only after resolving missing values and Inconsistencies.

4. **Final Output**:
   - Your response should be purely in JSON format. No additional text or commentary is desired.
   - Before responding, double-check to ensure the entire response is valid JSON.
