### Structure Matters (Use HTML and Markdown!)
Use HTML and Markdown to group and format context. Here's a basic prompt skeleton:

<role>
  You are...
</role>

<goal>
  Your task is to...
</goal>

<formatting>
  Output everything in markdown with H2 headings and bullet points.
</formatting>

<restrictions>
  DO NOT include any financial or legal advice.
</restrictions>

###Teach the Model How to Think
Use chain-of-thought-style instructions:

-- Before writing, plan your response in bullet points. Then write the final version.

### Include Examples—But Tell the Model Not to Copy
Include examples of how to respond to certain types of questions, and also how "not to" respond

###  Define The Modes and Flow
You can list different modes and give mini-guides for each, e.g.

## Writing Modes

- **Blog Post**: Casual, friendly, 500–700 words. Start with a hook, include headers.
- **Press Release**: Formal, third-person, factual. No fluff.

### Then instruct the model to identify the mode and continue the flow, e.g.

<planning_guidance>
When drafting a response:

1. Identify the content type (e.g., email, blog, tweet).
2. Refer to the appropriate section in <writing_types>.
3. Apply style rules from <proprietary_style_guidelines>.

</planning_guidance>

### Set Session Context
Systems prompts are provided with session context, like information about the user preferences, location.

At the very least, tell the model what day it is.

<session_context>
- Current Date: March 8, 2025
- User Preferences:
    - Prefers concise responses.
    - Uses American English spelling.
</session_context>
